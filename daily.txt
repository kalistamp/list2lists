### 2024-04-16 | START OF NEW PROJECT FREOM LIST (Donald Duck)




* ```Delete this later on after some review``` Applied to some JBS: Fedex, harborfreight, ...




* Start Project - **Donald Duck**




[Raspberry Pi Pico Ducky Script Not Executing Payload.dd file](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/rb9n8v/raspberry_pi_pico_ducky_script_not_executing/) - - the Adafruits Libs and the Circuitpy Release Versions downloaded and used did not match i thought this may be the issue... tried to fix this issue by using the same release versions but still was not able to get Ducky to RUN




Holding Down BOOTSEL button upon download will reset the PiPico




 Check OS compatibility of the Ducky payload before you try to run some are specific to Win or MacOS




* VPS Servers All expired




* **News worth noting:**




```Huge Problem with  the release of open source WizardLM-2 LLM being removed by Microsoft because it never went through "toxicity check" Testing before being released, Alot of ppl feel this is overeach and adding unnecessary censorship ... "Ollama was the fastest pull.  (ollama run wizardlm2)" ... I see this and want to know other options besides using ollama that you can run an LLM locally. incase a Model is pulled like it was in this example how can it be stored locally for myself as well so that i will not lose access to it```

### 2024-04-27 | Finally got VPS Working




* Had to reinstall OS for the VPS i bought on anonRDP. Finally got Windows installed and downloaded visual studio and conti files to be told Conti SLN file will only work on ```Visual Studio 2015```

* Next Looked as PSransom but saw the tool and tutorial are displayed as being setup and ran on linux machine...

* 













***




### 2024-05-01 | Moved From Conti onto Lockbit







* Had trouble building Sln files for Conti because VS code 2015 was required, - - - Decided to test out lockbit instead

* Lockbit Worked Fine and Displayed Msg... ```Should i Test it one more time ?```

* Trojans and Stealer are more prevalant than RAN... May move back into Trojans and stealers instead - - Saw that ```Async``` HVNC and sockets (the connection) are shit so i will try something better that was been leaked such as ```Xworm``` or ```seroxen```







***







### 2024-05-02 | HVNC for Xworm (skid) Vs Seroxen (superior)




* Updated and Posted Src Files here: https://github.com/c2dmp/dmp










* Explaining HVNC:







```




HVNC stands for Hidden Virtual Network Computing. It is a tactic used by cybercriminals to gain user-grade access to an infected PC without the victim's knowledge. This tactic is commonly used in online banking fraud scenarios, where cybercriminals use remote control tactics to commit financial fraud, often with and without actual malware on the victim's endpoint. The hidden virtual network computing (HVNC) module allows attackers to control a machine without the victim's knowledge, providing them with access to the victim's computer for malicious purposes




Hidden VNC is a creative solution to a problem that stemmed from banking fraud. It is a complicated malware feature that requires coders to implement their own window manager, which is why there are very few unique implementations in the wild. Most malware uses a single implementation unimaginatively named HVNC 




.

In the context of computing, HVNC refers to a system where a group of computer networks are connected to each other to securely exchange data and information. It allows multiple computers or networks within an organization to connect and securely exchange data, often over the internet or through a dedicated private network infrastructure set up between the networks involved 




.

In the broader context of computing, Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a graphical desktop-sharing system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer protocol (RFB) to remotely control another computer. It transmits the keyboard and mouse input from one computer to another, relaying the graphical-screen updates over a network 




.

In summary, HVNC is a tactic used by cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access to a victim's computer, particularly in the context of online banking fraud. It is a form of hidden virtual network computing that allows attackers to control a machine without the victim's knowledge, and it is a complex malware feature that requires specific coding skills to implement effectively

Decided to go with Async anyway to test out a rat and got this short conversation on Tele:




( Check Malware Hunters on Tele and test all the tools posted to see which ones are best )




```







Byte Belle

Im still having trouble getting async or any exe to bypass WD do you know any good methods. Would syswhisper still work?




USER1

No




Byte Belle, [5/2/2024 10:22 PM]

any good alternatives than syswhisper?




USER1

Your malware is dotnet or native?




Byte Belle, [5/2/2024 10:23 PM]

besides a cryper they seems to be alot

native hosted on a vps

never successfully spread in wild yet

using with pwndrop




USER1

Your sample file detected at scan time?




Byte Belle, [5/2/2024 10:26 PM]

yeah cant even get past basic WD smh

i know i could pay for a crypt but i was wondering if there were any other free alternatives i could work with first

syswhisper3 no good at all?




USER1

Then you compile ready-made source code, itz expected to be detected. Learn evasion techniques or buy a crypter




USER1

Man, thatll only hide calls. Itz not an adequate evasion technique on its own




Byte Belle, [5/2/2024 10:30 PM]

aight got it ill look into evasion techniques  and memory persistence more thanks

dll sideloading still a good working optionA?




USER1

Yh, actively used by APT groups




```




* Only $45 for a week trial for [Kangal](https://wdkiller.com/) crypter, may need to test this if other evasion techniques dont work such as dll sideloading




* D.Bombal Active directory Attacks [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsS7VITiUXo&t=512s)




'''NOTES FROM VIDEO:'''https://medium.com/@bartukilickaya/unauthorized-access-to-ntds-dit-file-in-domain-controllers-69505ec67f20




usually [compromise domain](  add link above here) obtain ntds.dit which gives all hashes for all users in active directory enviroment and crack hash a for user credentials (19:14mins)

### 2024-05-03 | BALANCE Current Fun Project(s) & COURSE OBJECTIVE




* I need to work harder on time management and CLEAR seperation between the two (BALANCE Current Fun Project(s) & COURSE OBJECTIVE) if i want to actually achieve anything meaningful by the end of the year. Going Forward i need to input notes from Comptia A+ studies into a github repository (Also make note that there is saved documents for study on hard drive)




* If Async is a tool i want to test out i need to find a way to bypass basic WD if i am to try sending out any emails to get the stub to actually bit on any real victims in the wild... [Source](https://gatari.dev/posts/a-trip-down-memory-lane/) I can try and read.... I read the whole article it seems at the end adding to exlusion was the answer LOL... How about [THIS](https://amajax.medium.com/bypass-windows-defender-with-1-line-powershell-command-57dec5d1edb) now, maybe this dropper would work?

### 2024-05-12 | Sunday Workflow + SMTP setup




* News: here







* [Portable Apps](https://portableapps.com/apps/internet#google_vignette) - Example use-case: ```I have a home-computer used by

several family-members for leisurely activities. I also

use it for work and have an encrypted drive to keep my

work-related activity and files separate. I'd like to put a

self-contained browser on the encrypted hard-drive so

my family-members can't mess with my work-related

online activity. What options would I have for such a browser```




* After almost paying for a Zoho plan i ended up going with SMTP2GO along with Thunderbird Client to send out emails using my Domain. Configuration was far from easy and i am still currently having trouble setting up new email alias again after i added CNAME records to domain registrar...




Currently only working alias is ```sugasean@topia.ink``` could not get ```hazypulp@topia.ink``` to configure properly...




Here is Accnt information for SMTP2GO to work further on this later: Login - ```sugasean@topia.ink``` | Pass - ```Fuckmail```




* How to add a new email alias for a domain on Thunderbird




```




Open Thunderbird

Click the three horizontal lines in the upper right corner of the main window

Select Account Settings

Click Manage Identities in the bottom right corner

Click Add

Enter the name and email address you want to use




```

* Did it again But this time asked about the chrome extensions in the Picture:




```




I apologize for the confusion. Let's focus on identifying the Chrome extensions based on the icons displayed in the browser's extension toolbar.




From left to right, the visible Chrome extension icons appear to be:




Orange Shield with a white checkmark: This is likely Grammarly.

Purple Hexagon with a white number inside: This is likely Wappalyzer.

Blue envelope icon: This is likely Mailtrack.

Gray cloud with an arrow inside: This is likely Nimbus Screenshot & Screen Video Recorder.

Bug icon: This is likely Google Analytics Debugger or a similar debugging tool.

Green shield with a checkmark: This is likely HTTPS Everywhere.

Red exclamation mark inside a shield: This is likely Adblock Plus.

Blue shield icon: This is likely uBlock Origin.

Red letter "S": This is likely Stylus or Tampermonkey.




```

### 2024-06-04 | Start Burpsuite THM / Just Exploring







* Some More random finds from exploring on Tele:




[Subdomain](https://subdomainfinder.c99.nl/) (Can look at recently searched domains) 




```https://xss.report/``` - The site likely provides tools and resources for identifying, testing, and understanding XSS vulnerabilities, helping developers and security professionals to secure their applications against such attacks. It may also offer educational content on different types of XSS attacks, such as reflected, stored, and DOM-based XSS, and best practices for preventing these vulnerabilities.




* No News Todays :(

**Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs:**




Derived from a 1943 paper " A thoery of Human Motivation"




```




Physiological Needs: These are our basic survival needs like food, water, and sleep.




Safety Needs: This level includes job security, personal safety, and financial stability.




Love and Belonging Needs: We all have a need for friendship, intimacy, and a sense of belonging.




Esteem: This level is about gaining recognition, respect, and self-confidence.




Self-Actualization: The highest level represents the desire to reach our full potential and achieve personal growth.







According to Maslow, we must satisfy lower-level needs before attending to higher ones. However, it's important to note that these needs are not mutually exclusive.

They can coexist and influence our behavior simultaneously.

**Martin Seligman positive psychology -  Based off his PERMA Model**




[Martin Seligman TED Talk - The new era of positive psychology](https://www.ted.com/talks/martin_seligman_the_new_era_of_positive_psychology?subtitle=en&trigger=15s)




```




The PERMA model, developed by Martin Seligman, is a comprehensive framework within positive psychology designed to enhance well-being and happiness. It consists of five core elements:




**Positive Emotion**, which involves experiencing joy, gratitude, and other positive feelings;




**Engagement**, characterized by deep involvement in activities that challenge and absorb us, often leading to a state of flow;




**Relationships**, emphasizing the importance of healthy, supportive connections with others;




**Meaning**, which pertains to having a sense of purpose and belonging to something greater than oneself;




**Accomplishment**, focusing on achieving goals and mastering skills to foster a sense of competence and success. Together, these elements provide a holistic approach to understanding and improving individual and collective well-being, promoting a balanced and fulfilling life.

**News:**




Telegram has been named the favorite messenger of cybercriminals in the first half of 2024, according to Dmitry Kiryushkin, the head of BI.ZONE (website) Brand Protection. The study recorded over 66,000 mentions of Telegram and over 22,000 mentions of private messages on dark forums. Kiryushkin noted that Telegram attracts cybercriminals of various types due to its large user base of 900 million people, facilitating quick victim targeting and communication. While Telegram is considered secure and convenient within darknet communities, cybercriminals also use Tox, Jabber, and Discord, depending on their goals and desired anonymity level.

**News:**




Phishing videos for Android owners have started circulating on Telegram

Users are prompted to open the video through a third-party player, and when they do, malware is downloaded onto their device.

You probably weren't planning on opening videos from unknown users, but caution is always a good idea.







On 2024-07-18, CrowdStrike deployed a defective update that leads to Windows machines running CrowdStrike Falcon being stuck in an endless boot loop (or BSOD).

[Update on Rockyou2024 List:](https://specopssoft.com/blog/rockyou2024-analysis-password-leak/) at least 9 billion of those aren't actual passwords but generated combinations of ASCII characters which may or may not be passwords. the "leaker" just added all actually breached and known passwords to the old list, which was completely useless. so this is at least 90% useless and probably 9% well known and already in HIBP... the other 1% isn't worth downloading it since you would have no way to differentiate between those groups.

IntelBrokers breaches are so mundane and easy to do that literally anyone could do them. I'll give a simple example of how




First find a source of free stealer logs, you can find many users giving them out for free on sites like xss.is or on telegram (https://t.me/addlist/x42QoPnTf8E3YzM0). Next you will want to extract as many as possible from their archive form, now install ripgrep (https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) and change directory to where you have extracted the logs.




Now run the command

rg -oUNI "URL:\s(.*?)[|\r]\nUsername:\s(.*?)[|\r]\nPassword:\s(.*?)[|\r]\n" -r '$1:$2:$3' --glob-case-insensitive -g "Passwords.txt" > combined.txt




This will create a file of url:user:pass entries from your collection of stealer logs which can easily by searched by your tool of choice; klogg, ripgrep even notepad.




Now to find the *good* stuff you will need to know some very basic regex here is an example of a ripgrep command using regex to find all email addresses with the prefix 'admin'.




rg -ai 'admin@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+' combined.txt




This will output every email that starts with 'admin' to your terminal you can now try to login to these stolen credentials and if they work! export the sites data or scrape it with a shitty python script and LARP being a 1337 ultra uber hakker XD.




Here is an even better command that will allow you to LARP as well or even as better than IntelBroker




rg -ai 'https?://(?:git|gitlab)\.[^\s/$.?#].[^\s]*' combined.txt




You can now use the outputted credentials to login to small to medium sized companies (that don't use 2FA) with the stolen credentials found and use a tool like git-dumper (https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper) to dump their source code repositories. You can now search the dumped repos for any database credentials, dump the database and post it to your hacking forum of choice! 




If there is no database credentials, follow IntelBrokers example and make a sales thread for the source code. No one will buy it (because no one cares XD) but still after a week mark the thread as [SOLD] to keep up the LARP so you can keep pretending to be a big bad hacker. 🔥

Domain name selection is an important aspect of preparation for penetration tests and especially Red Team engagements. Commonly, domains that were used previously for benign purposes and were properly categorized can be purchased for only a few dollars. Such domains can allow a team to bypass reputation based web filters and network egress restrictions for phishing and C2 related tasks.

This Python based tool was written to quickly query the Expireddomains.net search engine for expired/available domains with a previous history of use. It then optionally queries for domain reputation against services like Symantec Site Review (BlueCoat), IBM X-Force, and Cisco Talos. The primary tool output is a timestamped HTML table style report.

This office is not a government

given to them. In previous books, I have

mentioned that SSNs such as 987-65-

but they appear fake if scrutinized.

Therefore, I gave her 666-12-9873.

Many years ago, the Social Security

Administration decided that they

would not issue SSNs which began with

666 because it was commonly believed

to be the “sign of the beast”.

https://huggingface.co/spaces/DontPlanToEnd/UGI-Leaderboard




UGI: Uncensored General Intelligence. A measurement of the amount of uncensored/controversial information an LLM knows and is willing to tell the user. It is calculated from the average score of 5 subjects LLMs commonly refuse to talk about. The leaderboard is made of roughly 65 questions/tasks, measuring both willingness to answer and accuracy in fact-based controversial questions. I'm choosing to keep the questions private so people can't train on them and devalue the leaderboard.




#P: Position on the Leaderboard, Lower = Less Censorship

**Path to uncensored LLM**




* Literature read on how to achieve this




https://erichartford.com/uncensored-models




```




Most of these models (for example, Alpaca, Vicuna, WizardLM, MPT-7B-Chat, Wizard-Vicuna, GPT4-X-Vicuna) have some sort of embedded alignment. For general purposes, this is a good thing. This is what stops the model from doing bad things, like teaching you how to cook meth and make bombs. But what is the nature of this alignment?

```




I'm using local models for two reasons.




First, I wanted to understand how the technology works. I've written a couple programs, one to load a LLM model and some PDFs then ask questions about the PDF contents, and a second to understand how to load Stable Diffusion models and generate images.




Second, I wanted to be able to use LLMs to query PDFs such as technical papers. I am able to load up ti 13B parameter models and have mixed results with their accuracy.




Currently I'm slowly working thru Andrej Karpathy's makemore videos to understand more of the details of how LLM models work, but that's slow going as I have none of the math background, but I have learned a bit.

**Transfering Docker to External Drive***




MY PROBLEM HERER I THINK IS THE CONTAINER IS 300GB SPACE STORED, I NEEED TO LOOK INTO CREATING CONTAINERS THAT DO NOT TAKE UP 300GB IN THE FUTURE




```( Below is a chat gpt response helping with instructions found on reddit for this solution for changing Docker's storage location [Source](https://poe.com/s/cAbK0mBdrawR1zJeni7W) )```







Certainly, I can provide you with the equivalent instructions for Windows. Here's how you can change Docker's storage location on a Windows system:




1. Stop Docker Desktop:

   - Right-click on the Docker icon in the system tray

   - Select "Quit Docker Desktop"




2. Edit or create the daemon configuration file:

   - Open File Explorer and navigate to `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.docker`

   - If `daemon.json` doesn't exist, create a new text file and name it `daemon.json`

   - Open `daemon.json` with a text editor (like Notepad)




3. Add or modify the following content in the `daemon.json` file:




```

{

  "builder": {

    "gc": {

      "defaultKeepStorage": "20GB",

      "enabled": true

    }

  },

  "experimental": false,

  "data-root": "D:\\path\\to\\externaldrive\\docker-files"

}

```




Replace `D:\\path\\to\\externaldrive\\docker-files` with the actual path where you want Docker to store its data. Use double backslashes `\\` for directory separators in Windows paths.




4. If you want to keep your existing Docker data:

   - Open File Explorer and navigate to `C:\ProgramData\Docker`

   - Copy all contents from this folder to your new location specified in `daemon.json`




5. Restart Docker Desktop:

   - Start Docker Desktop from the Start menu or desktop shortcut




After completing these steps, Docker should now use the new location for storing its data.




Note: Depending on your Windows version and Docker Desktop settings, you might need to run Docker Desktop as an administrator for these changes to take effect.




Would you like me to explain any part of these instructions in more detail?







```[Q:]```  i tried step 4 but my container that was made before is still missing




TEST THIS STILLLLL    . . . . . . . . I NEED 300 GB AVAILABLE ... TEST THIS ON PLEX




I apologize for the confusion. If your previously created container is still missing after changing the data-root, it's likely because the data wasn't properly migrated. Let's try to recover your container by following these steps:




1. First, stop Docker Desktop completely if it's running.




2. Locate the original Docker data directory. By default, it's typically in one of these locations:

   - `C:\ProgramData\Docker`

   - `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Docker`




3. In this original location, look for a folder named `containers`. This is where information about your containers is stored.




4. Copy the entire `containers` folder from the original location to your new data-root location: `D:\docker_wrk\`




5. Also, copy these folders if they exist in the original location:

   - `image`

   - `volumes`

   - `buildkit`




6. After copying, your `D:\docker_wrk` directory should have a structure similar to this:

   ```

   D:\docker_wrk\

   ├── containers\

   ├── image\

   ├── volumes\

   ├── buildkit\

   └── ... (other folders)

   ```




7. Start Docker Desktop again.




8. Open a command prompt and run:

   ```

   docker ps -a

   ```

   This should list all your containers, including the ones that were created before changing the data-root.




If your container is still not visible, we might need to try a different approach:




1. In the original Docker data location, look for a file named `meta.db` in the `containers` folder.




2. Copy this `meta.db` file to the `containers` folder in your new location (`D:\docker_wrk\containers\`).




3. Restart Docker Desktop again and check if your container appears.




If these steps don't work, it's possible that the container's data might not be fully recoverable. In this case, you might need to recreate the container.




For future reference, it's always a good idea to export important containers or commit them to images before making significant changes to Docker's configuration.




Let me know if this helps or if you need any further assistance!

**Search Ollama built in Library**




[Ollama Library](https://ollama.com/library)




**Ollama Notes**




* You can use the ```free``` command to check memory usage on linux machine: ```free -h```




* First install Curl after an update: ```apt-get install -y curl```




* Next download ollama with curl on machine: ```curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh```




* Verify the installation path for ollama: ```which ollama```




*  Launch Ollama server: ```ollama serve```




* * To Pull a model to Ollama use: ```ollama pull <model name>```




* To list all available models in Ollama: ```ollama list```




* After reviewing the models downloaded on your machine using "list command remove a model to create more memory on machine with rn command: ```ollama rm <model_name_from_list>```




* To connect to this server and use Ollama, you should now be able to open a new Powershell terminal window or tab and run Ollama commands... You can do it like this when using docker: ```docker exec -it <container_name_or_id> bash```




* To log your entire interaction with Ollama into a text file using tee: ```ollama run wizard-vicuna-uncensored:latest | tee ollama_conversation.txt```




* Then transfer the Files out of the docker container onto the host windows machine: ```docker cp cranky_bouman:/home/ubuntu/tst.txt <THE SPLIT IS HERE DELETE THIS> C:\Users\kalistamp\Documents\XuanZhi64\tst.txt```




[!] LLM DIRECTIONS:




To transfer the text file from your Linux container to your Windows host machine, you can use the following docker cp command: 




```docker cp cranky_bouman:/path/to/file/in/container.txt C:\path\on\windows\host\```










* More Ollama commands i found that can be used:




```ollama show``` - Display information about a model




```ollama push``` - Push a model to a registry




```ollama cp``` - Copy a model







* Check out some [test prompts](https://github.com/declare-lab/red-instruct/blob/main/README.md) to eval a models censorship lvl




* Best models tested for the day:




```

krith/meta-llama-3.1-8b-instruct:IQ4_XS    e38a8fa03138    4.4 GB    About an hour ago

wizard-vicuna-uncensored:latest            72fc3c2b99dc    3.8 GB    4 hours ago




```




[ Decided to try and look into logging so that allmy chats with the model would be saved after use, but i edited the ./bashrc file in root and think i destroyed the server. whole directories are hidden or missing and im gaving troubl changing around - Look into logging everything on the terminal when working with llm so i have chat history and evidence to review -  " wizard-vicuna-uncensored " gave me the most success from test prompts sourced from [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1bhvlo2/comment/kvgm26w/) Reddit Post, specifically this [Guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1bhvlo2/comment/kvgm26w/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) ]

* Game: Jailbreak models in [RedAreana](https://redarena.ai/)

* Use [LM-Arena](https://lmarena.ai/) to test multiple models at the same time with a prompt to see the different outputs




Both Sources above came from this HN [Ppost](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41649763)







**Understanding token counts**




```Here are some helpful rules of thumb for understanding tokens in terms of lengths: 1 token ≈ 4 chars in English. On average, one word is equivalent to about 1 - 1.5 tokens in English.```




Model Size vs. Token Count: A 3B parameter model trained on 25M Tokens of data, For a 3B parameter model, 25M tokens is a relatively small amount of training data. This suggests the training was likely fine-tuning or specialization rather than full pre-training.




**Understanding Models Token context length window**




Implications of context length window




1. Extended Memory: The model can "remember" and process about 16,000 tokens of information at once, which is roughly equivalent to 12,000-13,000 words or about 20-25 pages of text3.




2. Improved Coherence: With this large context window, the model can maintain coherence over longer passages, understanding and referencing information from earlier parts of the input more effectively2.




3. Complex Task Handling: The extended context allows for more sophisticated analysis, summarization, and generation tasks that require understanding large amounts of text at once3.




4. Reduced Need for Chunking: Unlike models with smaller context windows, this model can process longer documents or conversations without the need to break them into smaller pieces, which can lead to more cohesive and contextually aware outputs.
